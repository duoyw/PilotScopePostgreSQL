 * send_and_receive.c
 *	  Routines to send PilotTransData to python side.
 * 
 * We send data back to python side here. Note that we are able to reinit and 
 * resend the data if we don't receive response. However, the times we redo the above
 * operation is limited, which could tune MAX_SEND_TIMES in "utils/pilotscope_config.h".
 * In addtion, we could tune WAITE_TIME to decide how much time we should wait to receive
 * data.
 * 
 * The following is an example of json needed to parse: 
 * {
 * "tid": "1234",
 * "parser_time": "0.000051",
 * "http_time": "1234567809.123456",
 * "subquery":
 * [
 *   "select count(*) from comments c;",
 *   "select count(*) from posts p where p.answercount <= 5 and p.favoritecount >= 0 and p.posttypeid = 2;",
 *   "select count(*) from comments c, posts p where c.postid = p.id and p.answercount <= 5 and p.favoritecount >= 0 and p.posttypeid = 2;"
 * ],
 * "card":
 * [
 *   "174305.000",
 *   "3157.472",
 *   "5982.875"
 * ],
 * "anchor_names":
 * [
 *   "SUBQUERY_CARD_FETCH_ANCHOR"
 * ],
 * "anchor_times":
 * [
 *   "0.000129"
 * ]
 *}
 *
 * Attributes:
 *      tid:the process ID used by python side
 * 		parser_time:the time of parsing json
 * 		http_time:the moment sending data to python side
 * 		subquery:relative subqueries needed by subquery_card_fetcher_anchor
 * 		card:cards needed by subquery_card_fetcher_anchor
 * 		anchor_names:the anchor names needed to record time 
 * 		anchor_times:the time of dealing anchors, which are aligned with anchor_names
